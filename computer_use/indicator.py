"""What a desktop tool tells the on-screen indicator before it acts.

The person at the screen should see that vadgr is driving it, what it is about
to do, and where, and should be able to stop it with Esc. On GNOME the shell
extension draws that (see ``platform/backends/gnome_shell.py``); this module
decides what to tell it. It is pure: a tool name and its arguments in, a
``Cue`` out, so the wording and the coordinates are tested without a shell.

Only the tools that act on the desktop are cued: the native UI tools, the
pixel tools and ``app_open``. The browser tier drives a page, not the desktop,
and the Tier 0 tools touch no window.
