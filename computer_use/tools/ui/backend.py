"""The structured (AT-SPI) tier's backend seam.

The four ui_* tools are thin over a StructuredBackend: they resolve the backend
for the running session, call it, and normalise the result. The backend is
optional at import and optional at runtime - a box with no accessibility bus
must still start and answer ``at_spi_unavailable`` rather than fail, which is the
lesson 0.6.6 shipped. Resolution therefore never raises: it returns None, and the
tools report the remedy.

Errors are named and absence is not one: an empty match is a successful read, not
a failure (conflating them teaches a model to retry a working tool). A stale ref
is ``element_gone`` and never degrades to clicking an old coordinate - re-acting
on where something used to be is the exact failure a structured tier removes.
