"""The Linux structured tier: an AT-SPI2 backend over pure-python D-Bus.

There is no off-the-shelf pure-python AT-SPI2 client, so this is a from-scratch
one, scoped to only the interfaces the four ui_* tools need: Accessible (walk,
role, name, state), Component (extents, focus), Action (click and friends) and
EditableText (set_text). It speaks D-Bus with dbus-fast because the packaged
alternatives do not fit this repo's install contract: pyatspi is not on PyPI and
gi.Atspi needs system PyGObject, which an isolated venv (no system site packages)
cannot import. dbus-fast is a plain wheel, so a plain ``pip install`` gets it.

The backend depends on a small synchronous ``_Client`` seam, not on D-Bus
directly. The real client wraps dbus-fast on a private event-loop thread; a fake
client stands in for the unit tests, so the ref lifecycle, the verb-to-interface
mapping and the error names are all provable without a live accessibility bus.

Two facts about the tree the backend is built around, both observed on a real
GNOME 50 / Wayland box and not assumed:

- **On Wayland the compositor withholds a client's global surface position**, so
  Component extents come back window-relative with origin (0, 0). Grounding a
  Tier 2 pixel click on them is therefore an X11-only capability, and the
  capability block reports ``coordinate_trust`` so a caller never aims a pixel at
  a Wayland origin.
- **The action a button exposes is named "Click", capitalised**, and toolkits
  differ, so verbs are matched against the element's own action list
  case-insensitively rather than by a hard-coded string.
